REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
======================

Pong
----

`Pong <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong>`_ is the first computer game I 
ever played back in the 70s, and therefore I like the idea of teaching it to  
a computer. It feels like returning the favor.

Besides, the great Andrej Karpathy has written a wonderfully clear post on 
training machines to play `Pong` using the conceptually simple 
`Policy Gradients` technique. You can find the post here - 
`http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/ <http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/>`_

So `Pong` it is. 


Prepare a Game for RL
---------------------

When I program a new game in Jupylet I enjoy doing it interactively in a 
Jupyter notebook while the game is running. This is how the Jupylet example 
notebooks were created. However, to programmatically control a game in RL we 
need it in the form of a Python module, and we need to define the ``step()``,
``observe()``, and ``reset()`` functions.

To convert a Jupylet game into a Python module, simply select 
`Download as Python` from the Jupyter notebook :guilabel:`File` menu. 

Alternatively you can select and copy all the notebook cells with 
:guilabel:`Ctrl+A` and :guilabel:`Ctrl+C` and then paste everything into a 
text editor. However, in this case you will need to manually comment out 
any markup text.

Let's try that with the `Pong` example notebook `examples/21-pong.ipynb <https://github.com/nir/jupylet/blob/master/examples/21-pong.ipynb>`_.
That notebook implements a two player version of `Pong`. Run it to see what 
it does and then convert it to a Python module by the name `21-pong.py` and 
save it in the `examples/` folder.

If you did it correctly you should be able to run the game from a Miniconda 
prompt with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python examples/21-pong.py

Technically speaking `21-pong.py` is a Python script, not a module. A Python
module is a collection of functions and data structures that is meant to be 
imported, not run; a library that other modules or scripts may import for its 
functionality. It should not start a game of its own accord.

However, in Python the distinction between scripts and modules is a bit blurry 
and scripts often double as modules and vice versa.

It's actually nice to be able to run the `Pong` game from the command line, 
so let's keep that functionality and modify `21-pong.py` to double as a python 
module.

To do that open the file in a text editor and replace the 
:meth:`app.run() <jupylet.app.App.run>` call at the end of the file with:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

This is a very `common programming pattern in Python <https://realpython.com/python-main-function/>`_.
The magical `__name__` variable will only equal `'__main__'` if  
`21-pong.py` is run as a Python script (e.g. as we did above).

Next we need to fix the module's filename. While you can name 
a Python script anything you want, Python module names follow the same 
restrictions as Python variable names and cannot contain dashes; therefore, a 
filename like `pong.py` would be much better.

However, don't rename the file just yet since we have already done that for 
you, and we have also added example definitions for the ``step()``,
``observe()``, and ``reset()`` functions. 

You can find the final version of the `Pong` game in its module form at 
`examples/pong.py <https://github.com/nir/jupylet/blob/master/examples/pong.py>`_.

The ``step()``, ``observe()``, and ``reset()`` functions are not strictly 
required, rather they are recommended as a pattern supported by the Jupylet 
API, and as a programmer you are free to define their inputs and outputs in 
any way you wish.

The ``step()`` function should be called with an `action` and should 
return the next `observation` and `reward` from the game environment; the 
``observe()`` function should return an `observation` of the environment; and 
the ``reset()`` function should be called to reset the game state to a 
predefined state (e.g. the beginning of the game).

Let's take a look at how these three functions are defined for our `Pong` 
game:

.. code-block:: python

    def step(player0=[0, 0], player1=[0, 0], n=1):
        
        # Convert the first player's action to pressing the A or D keys.
        state.key_a, state.key_d = player0
        
        # Convert the second player's action to pressing the left or right key.
        state.left, state.right = player1
        
        # Take a snapshot of the scoreboard before the step.
        score0 = state.score0
        score1 = state.score1
        
        app.step(n)
            
        # Compute reward from change in scoreboard.
        reward = (state.score0 - score0) - (state.score1 - score1)

        return observe(reward)


    def observe(reward=0):

        return {
            'screen0': app.observe(),
            'player0': {'score': state.score0, 'reward': reward},
            'player1': {'score': state.score1, 'reward': -reward},
        }


    def reset():
        load('pong-start.state')
        return observe()


The particular ``reset()`` function defined above relies on  
``load()`` and ``save()`` functions. This is how they are defined in
the `pong` module:


.. code-block:: python

    def load(path):
        app.load_state(path, state, ball, padl, padr, scorel, scorer)
        return observe()
        

    def save(path=None):
        app.save_state('pong', path, state, ball, padl, padr, scorel, scorer)


The arguments to the :meth:`app.load_state() <jupylet.app.App.load_state>` 
and :meth:`app.save_state() <jupylet.app.App.save_state>` functions,
namely `state`, `ball`, `padl`, `padr`, `scorel`, `scorer` are the global
game objects that uniquely determine the game state. In general you can 
include any object that implements the ``get_state()`` and ``set_state()`` 
methods.


Control a Game Instance
-----------------------

The code to control our little game of `Pong` is in the 
`examples/22-pong-RL.ipynb <https://github.com/nir/jupylet/blob/master/examples/22-pong-RL.ipynb>`_ 
notebook. Let's see how it's done.

.. note::
    The two functions ``show_image()`` and ``show_images()`` used here to show
    numpy arrays as bitmap images are defined in the notebook.

Creating a game instance is as easy as this:

.. code-block:: python

    import jupylet.rl

    pong = jupylet.rl.GameProcess('pong')

Next, to start the game in a new child process, run:

.. code-block:: python

    game.start()

Once the game has started you can observe the game environment. You can 
program the `pong` module to return anything you want in response to 
the ``observe()`` call. In the case of our example `Pong` it returns a 
dictionary such as the following:

.. code-block:: python

    In []: pong.observe()
    Out[]: {'screen0': array([[[124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    ...,
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255]],
            
                    ...,
            
                    [[124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    ...,
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255],
                    [124, 113, 218, 255]]], dtype=uint8),
            'player0': {'score': 0, 'reward': 0},
            'player1': {'score': 0, 'reward': 0}}

The `'screen0'` entry is a numpy array that contains a bitmap image 
of the game video at time t\ :sub:`0` represented as a 3 dimentional array. 
Let's show it as an image:

.. code-block:: python

    o = pong.observe()
    show_image(o['screen0'])

.. image:: ../images/pong.step0.png 

Now, let's play a few steps; both players choose the action to move their 
game paddles rightward for 5 consecutive steps:

.. code-block:: python

    o = pong.step(player0=[0, 1], player1=[0, 1], n=5)
    show_image(o['screen0'])

.. image:: ../images/pong.step5.png 

If you wanted them to move leftward you would use [1, 0] instead of [0, 1].
Finally, let's reset the game and start over:

.. code-block:: python

    pong.reset()

That's all there is to it.


Control Multiple Games
----------------------

It's all fine and dandy to control a game of `Pong` programmatically but we 
could just as easily control multiple games simultaneously.

Here is how you would create 3 simultaneous games:

.. code-block:: python

    games = jupylet.rl.Games(['pong', 'pong', 'pong'])
    games.start()

You can create more games with a longer list or mix different games in the
same list if you wish to.

Let's observe them:

.. code-block:: python

    ol = games.observe()
    show_images(o['screen0'] for o in ol)

.. image:: ../images/pong.x3.step0.png 

And step through five consecutive steps:

.. code-block:: python

    ol = games.step([[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]], [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0]], n=5)
    show_images(o['screen0'] for o in ol)

.. image:: ../images/pong.x3.step5.png 

For each of the players we supply an action for each of the simultaneous games. 
So [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]] means paddle to the `right` in the first game, to
`left` in the second, and to the `right` in the third ongoing game.

Finally let's reset them to their initial state:

.. code-block:: python

    games.reset()

By running multiple simultaneous games a single Linux machine with a GPU you 
can easily reach 4000 `Pong` frames per second. 


Jupylet in the Cloud
--------------------

To train any non trivial deep learning agent you need a machine that can 
compute trillions of multiplications and additions per second. Traditionally 
this simply means a machine with an Nvidia GPU.

If you have such a machine at home you can skip this section. If not, this 
section explains how to setup and run Jupylet on a remote Amazon EC2 instance
with a GPU.

Jupylet was tested on Amazon EC2 GPU servers running Ubuntu 18.04. If you 
haven't already setup an EC2 instance I recommend that you instantiate it 
from the `AWS Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-Deep-Learning-AMI-Ubuntu-1/B07Y43P7X5>`_
since it includes the required Nvidia drivers, CUDA, cuDNN, and conda.

To connect to your EC2 server you will need an SSH client. On Windows machines
you won't find anything better than the awesome `PuTTY <https://www.putty.org/>`_.

On a remote EC2 instance Jupylet runs in so called headless mode. This means 
it uses the Nvidia GPU to render game frames without creating a game window. 
To make this possible you will need to install a few packages by running 
the following commands in an SSH terminal on the remote instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update -y  
    sudo apt-get install -y mesa-utils libegl1-mesa xvfb freeglut3-dev

Next, create a new conda environment, activate it, and install Jupylet:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    conda create -y -n jpl python=3.9 pip
    conda activate jpl

    pip install jupylet

Next, download the jupylet repository so you may run its example notebooks:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y git

    git clone https://github.com/nir/jupylet.git

Now each time you would like to start a Jupyter notebook server on the remote 
instance, open an SSH terminal and type the following:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    screen
    conda activate jpl
    cd jupylet/examples
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=*

.. note::
    The `screen` program will prevent the Jupyter server from exiting if the 
    SSH terminal accidentally disconnects. If it does disconnect you may 
    reconnect to the running screen session with the ``screen -dr`` command.

The ``jupyter notebook`` command above should produce some output including a 
security token in the form of a long string of hex digits. Copy that token 
since you will soon need it.

Finally, open a new tab in your browser and navigate to port 8888 of the 
public DNS address of your EC2 instance. It should look something like 
`http://ec2-BLAH.BLAH.BLAH.compute.amazonaws.com:8888/`

If you did everything correctly you will be prompted to enter the security 
token that you copied above. Paste it in and you are done.

.. note::
    Jupyter notebook sessions use regular unsecure HTTP connections. If you 
    wish you can setup the Jupyter server to use HTTPS or limit the EC2 
    firewall to only allow connections from your IP address.
