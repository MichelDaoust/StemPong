INTRODUCTION
============

*Jupylet* is a Python library for programming 2D and 3D games, graphics,
music and sound synthesizers, interactively in a Jupyter notebook. It is 
intended for three types of audiences:

* Computer scientists, researchers, and students of deep reinforcement learning.
* Musicians interested in sound synthesis and live music coding.
* Kids and their parents interested in learning to program.

Jupylet for Kids
----------------

A Jupyter notebook is in essence a laboratory for programming. It is the ideal
environment for playing around with code, experimenting, and exploring ideas.
It is used by professional machine learning scientists who come every day to
play at work, so why not by kids?

*Jupylet* is wonderfully easy to use for creating simple 2D and 3D games and 
music interactively and experimentally. Change a variable or a function and 
see how the game is affected immediately while it is running.

Jupylet for Deep Reinforcement Learning
---------------------------------------

*Jupylet* makes it is super easy to create and modify environments in which to
experiment with deep reinforcement learning algorithms and it includes the API
to programmatically control multiple simultaneous games and render thousands 
of frames per second.

Consider for example the pong game included in this repository. With a few
lines of code you can modify the colors of the game to experiment with transfer 
learning, or turn the game into 4-way pong with agents on all four sides of the 
game court to experiment with cooperation between multiple agents. And since you 
can modify the game interactively in Jupyter this process is not only easy but 
also fun.

See the :any:`Programming Graphics<graphics>` and the 
:any:`Reinforcement Learning<rl>` chapters for more information.


Jupylet for Musicians
---------------------

*Jupylet* imports ideas and methods from machine learning into the domain
of sound synthesis to easily let you create sound synthesizers as wild as you
can dream up - it includes impulse response reverb effects, colored noise 
generators, resonant filters with cutoff frequency sweeping, oscillators with 
LFO modulation, multi sampled instruments, and much more... And all of it in 
pure Python for you to modify and experiment with.

In addition *Jupylet* draws inspiration from the wonderful `Sonic Pi <https://sonic-pi.net/>`_
and brings live loops and live music coding to Jupyter and Python. Hook up 
your MIDI keyboard and take off.

:any:`Programming Synthesizers<synthesis>` chapters for more information.
